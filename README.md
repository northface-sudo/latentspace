# User Documentation Manual for Latent-Trait Understanding and Scenario-Based Action Recommendation System

## Overview

The Latent-Trait Understanding and Scenario-Based Action Recommendation System is an innovative project aimed at understanding behavioral traits and providing personalized recommendations based on user narratives. By utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) models, this system extracts critical psychological and contextual insights, translating them into actionable advice for users in various scenarios, including scam reports and interviews.

## System Architecture
1. Phase 1: Understanding Layer

The Understanding Layer is responsible for extracting latent traits and behavioral indicators from user narratives. The following technologies and models are employed in this phase:

    Semantic Understanding:
        SBERT: Used for embedding sentence representations that capture contextual meaning.
        Instructor-XL: Enhances comprehension of user narratives.
        E5-Mistral: A versatile model for multilingual processing.
        GTE-Multilingual: Facilitates understanding across different languages.

    Summarization and Reasoning:
        LLaMA 3 and Qwen 2: These models summarize user input and assist in reasoning processes, generating concise and actionable summaries.

    Cognitive and Emotional Pattern Analysis:
        LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count): Analyzes emotional, cognitive, and structural components of text.
        Big Five Personality Models: Identifies user personality traits based on narrative content.

2. Phase 2: Recommendation Layer

The Recommendation Layer utilizes various algorithms to create personalized action plans:

    Algorithm Evaluation:
        NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering): Maps users to potential actions based on behavioral data.
        FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Facilitates efficient similarity search for user actions and preferences.
        LightGCN (Light Graph Convolutional Network): Improves recommendation accuracy by leveraging user-item interaction graphs.

    Conceptual Framework:
        Legal Guidance: Provides relevant legal advice tailored to the user's situation.
        Support Strategies: Suggests actionable support mechanisms and pathways for users.
        Buddy Consortium Model: Aggregates advice from multiple perspectives, encouraging collaboration and diverse input in decision-making.

## Usage Instructions
Setting Up the System

    Installation:
        Clone the repository from the project’s GitHub page.
        Install the required dependencies by running:

bash

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Prepping Data:
        Prepare user narrative data in a JSON format. Each entry should include fields for text, context, and any relevant metadata (e.g., user ID, timestamp).

    Configuring the Models:
        Modify the configuration files to set paths for the models (e.g., SBERT, LLaMA).
        Ensure that the necessary model files are downloaded and accessible to the project.

Running the System

    Launch Phase 1 (Understanding Layer):
        Execute the following command:

bash

    python run_understanding.py --data_path ./data/narratives.json

    Monitor the console for outputs indicating the extraction of latent traits and behavioral indicators.

Launch Phase 2 (Recommendation Layer):

    After phase 1 is complete, run:

bash

        python run_recommendation.py --input_path ./output/traits.json

        Review the generated recommendations, which will be saved in the specified output directory.

Accessing Results

    The results, including extracted traits and recommendations, will be found in the designated output files (in JSON or CSV format).
    Visual representations (if applicable) of the data can be generated by invoking built-in data visualization scripts.
