# Latent-Trait Understanding and Scenario-Based Action Recommendation System
We are developing a two-phase system to extract latent behavioral traits from text and generate personalized, context-aware recommendations. The system is designed to analyze user narratives—such as scam reports, interviews, and interaction logs—to identify psychological, relational, and contextual cues and translate them into actionable guidance.
